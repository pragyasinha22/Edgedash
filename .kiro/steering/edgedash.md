# EdgeDash — Project Steering Rules

## Project Overview

EdgeDash is an autonomous AI career intelligence agent. It runs as a scheduled loop that fetches live job listings, scores them for fit against a user profile, surfaces skill gaps, verifies its own output, and publishes a Streamlit dashboard.

---

## Architecture

Do not deviate from this architecture without explicitly telling the user first.

```
Trigger (scheduled)
  -> Orchestrator
    -> Fetcher        (sub-agent)
    -> Scorer         (sub-agent)
    -> GapAnalyzer    (sub-agent)
  -> Verifier
  -> Storage
  -> Dashboard        (read-only)
```

- The **Orchestrator** reads state and delegates work to sub-agents. It never fetches job data or scores listings directly.
- Each **sub-agent** has exactly one goal and one stop condition.
- The **Dashboard** is read-only. It never writes to storage.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Python 3.11+. Standard library first.**
   Add a third-party dependency only when it genuinely saves real work. State the reason before adding it.

2. **All storage access goes through a single `storage` module with a thin interface.**
   No other module may import `sqlite3` directly. The backend will switch from SQLite to hosted Postgres in week 4, and that must be a one-file change.

3. **Never hardcode user-specific values.**
   Role, city, keywords, and skills profile all live in config (e.g., `config.yaml` or a config module). No literals for these in any other file.

4. **No secrets in code.**
   All secrets and credentials are loaded from environment variables, in one place only (e.g., a dedicated `settings` or `env` module).

5. **Every agent run writes a row to `cycle_log`.**
   Required fields: what ran, timestamp, records touched, pass/fail status, and retry reason (if any).

6. **Fail loudly.**
   No bare `except: pass` or silent swallowing of errors. If something is wrong, it must surface visibly.

7. **Type hints on every function signature.**
   Docstrings only where the intent is not obvious from the function name.

8. **Keep files under ~150 lines.**
   Split a module before it becomes a problem, not after.

---

## Style

- Small, testable functions over large procedural blocks.
- Plain, readable Python over clever Python.
- When asked to build one module, build one module — do not scaffold the whole app.

---

## Network & Sources

9. **Every external source lives behind a `Source` class with a uniform interface.**
   The Fetcher never contains source-specific parsing. Adding a new source must never require editing the Fetcher.

10. **Every `Source` returns a list of normalised dicts with EXACTLY these keys:**
    `source`, `external_id`, `title`, `company`, `location`, `url`, `description`, `posted_at`, `raw`.
    Missing values are `None` — never empty string, never `"N/A"`.

11. **All network calls go through one shared helper.**
    The helper enforces a 10 s timeout, 2 retry attempts with exponential backoff, and a real `User-Agent` header.
    No bare `requests.get()` anywhere else in the codebase.

12. **A source failing must never kill the cycle.**
    Catch failures per-source, log to `cycle_log` with `status="failed"`, and continue to the next source.
    One dead job board must not stop the others.

13. **Secrets come from environment variables loaded via a `.env` file that is gitignored.**
    Never a literal key in code, never a key in `config.yaml`.
    If a required key is missing, that source skips itself with a clear log line — it does not crash the cycle.

14. **Respect the source.**
    Rate-limit to at most 1 request per second per source, set a real `User-Agent`, and honour any documented page limits.

---

## Intelligence & Scoring

15. **All LLM calls go through one module: `edgedash/llm.py`, exposing one function.**
    The provider and model name come from config, never hardcoded. Rate-limit to stay inside a free tier (default 1 request per second, max 15 per minute). No other file imports an LLM SDK directly.

16. **Never ask a model for a final score, ranking, or numeric rating.**
    The model extracts structured facts only. All scoring arithmetic is deterministic Python in ONE function. The model never sees the scoring weights.

17. **Every model response is validated against an explicit schema before use.**
    A response that fails validation is retried once, then logged as a failure for THAT listing only — it must not crash the cycle or stop the remaining listings. Never `json.loads` raw model text without a validation and repair path.

18. **Scoring is idempotent. Never re-score a listing that already has a score.**
    Select only listings `WHERE score IS NULL`. Cache extraction results keyed on a hash of the job description so the same text is never sent to the model twice.

19. **Every score carries a human-readable reason generated from the score components by our code — never free text written by the model.**

20. **Log the score distribution (count, min, max, mean, spread) to `cycle_log` on every scoring run.**
    A run where all scores fall within 10 points is a suspect run and must be logged as such.

21. **Cap listings scored per cycle at a configurable batch size (default 25).**
    This makes a cost or rate-limit blowup structurally impossible.

---

## Aggregate Analysis

22. **Aggregate analysis is deterministic SQL and Python.**
    No LLM call may produce, adjust, or rank an aggregate number. A model may only suggest canonical groupings for a human to approve.

23. **Skill names are canonicalised through an explicit alias map in `config.yaml` that I own and can read.**
    Never auto-merge skill names by model judgement or string similarity alone.

24. **Gap ranking is weighted by the fit score of the listing the gap came from.**
    A gap in a listing scored 20 is worth far less than a gap in a listing scored 85. Never rank gaps by raw frequency alone.

25. **Every gap report run writes a timestamped snapshot.**
    Never overwrite the previous report. Trend over time is a first-class output, not an afterthought.

26. **Every aggregate number must be traceable to the rows that produced it.**
    Any reported gap must be able to list the specific listing IDs it was computed from. No number appears in the dashboard that cannot be drilled into.

27. **Report the sample size alongside every aggregate.**
    A gap computed from 3 listings and a gap computed from 90 listings must never be presented as equally reliable.

---

## ORCHESTRATION

28. The Orchestrator reads system state and decides which agents to run.
    It never runs a fixed sequence. Skipping an agent because there is no
    work for it is a SUCCESSFUL outcome, not a failure.

29. Every delegation carries an explicit goal and an explicit stop
    condition (max items, max duration). A sub-agent never decides its own
    limits — the Orchestrator sets them.

30. The Orchestrator never does an agent's work. It reads state,
    delegates, collects results, logs. No fetching, scoring, or analysis
    logic in the Orchestrator.

31. The Orchestrator prints and logs its PLAN before executing it —
    which agents will run, which are skipped, and the state value that
    caused each decision.

32. One sub-agent failing does not stop the cycle. Log the failure,
    continue with the remaining plan, and mark the cycle partial.

33. Every cycle writes exactly one summary row: what ran, what was
    skipped, why, duration per agent, and the outcome.

---

## VERIFICATION

34. The Verifier judges output plausibility and NEVER repairs, rewrites,
    or adjusts data. It returns a verdict and a reason. The Orchestrator
    decides what to do about a failure.

35. Verification checks plausibility, never correctness. There is no
    ground truth for a fit score. Checks assert properties of the output
    distribution and shape, not the accuracy of any single value.

36. A failed verification triggers at most ONE retry of the failing agent
    with adjusted context. After that the cycle is marked "degraded" and
    stops. Never retry in an unbounded loop.

37. Every verdict is logged to cycle_log with the check that failed and
    the observed value that failed it — never just "failed".

38. Only cycles with a passing verdict may be read by the dashboard. A
    failed cycle must never overwrite the last known-good data. Stale
    verified data always beats fresh unverified data.

39. Verification thresholds live in config.yaml, not in code, and every
    threshold has a comment saying what failure it is designed to catch.

---

## NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES

40. NEVER generate SQL from a model. No text-to-SQL, ever, in any form.
    The model selects from a fixed registry of parameterised query
    functions that I wrote. It never composes a query.

41. Every query tool is read-only, parameterised, and takes typed
    parameters that are validated and clamped to a safe range before
    execution. A model-supplied parameter is untrusted input.

42. The model appears exactly twice per question: once to ROUTE (pick a
    tool and its parameters) and once to PHRASE (turn returned rows into
    prose). It never touches the database in either call.

43. The phrasing call may use ONLY the numbers present in the rows it was
    given. It must not estimate, extrapolate, add outside context, or
    infer a value that is not in the data. If the rows are empty it must
    say so plainly.

44. Every answer displays the underlying rows alongside it. No prose
    answer appears without the data that produced it.

45. If no tool matches the question, say so and list what CAN be asked.
    Never guess at the closest tool and never answer from general
    knowledge.

46. Query tools read from the last passing cycle only, per rule 38.

---

## DEPLOYMENT

47. Never rely on the local filesystem for anything that must survive a
    restart. Hosting filesystems are ephemeral. All persistent state is in
    the hosted database.

48. Every secret comes from an environment variable read in one place.
    No secret is ever committed, printed, logged, or shown in an error
    message or traceback.

49. The scheduled job and the dashboard are separate processes that share
    only the database. The dashboard never runs a cycle; the scheduler
    never serves a page.

50. The deployed app must start and render even when the database is
    empty, unreachable, or mid-migration. It shows a clear status message
    instead of a stack trace. A stranger must never see a traceback.

51. The scheduled job is idempotent and safe to run twice. It must have a
    hard timeout and stay inside free-tier limits.
